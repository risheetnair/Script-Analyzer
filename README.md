# Script Dialogue Density Visualizer

This project explores how dialogue, action, and character presence are distributed across film scripts. The goal is to surface pacing and structural patterns using data-driven analysis, without evaluating or scoring creative quality.

The tool is designed as an exploratory aid for understanding screenplay structure rather than a judgment system.

## Project Scope

This project focuses on:

- Parsing screenplay text into structured data
- Measuring dialogue density and character presence at the scene level
- Visualizing pacing patterns across scripts

Out of scope for the current version:

- Evaluating writing quality
- Predicting audience response or success
- Replacing creative judgment

## Data Sources

Script text is obtained from publicly accessible screenplay repositories and used for analysis only.  
Due to copyright restrictions, raw script text files are not included in this repository.

Analysis outputs include metrics, visualizations, and summaries derived from the text, not the text itself.

## Design Notes

Detailed parsing and normalization assumptions are documented in the `notes/` directory.
